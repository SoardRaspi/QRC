**Quantum-Hybrid Mixture-Based Network for Quantum Machine Learning**

In my journey of learning about Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning, I have seen quite a few projects and research papers, using the concept of Quantum-Hybrid networks or circuits with classical structures to enhance the different Machine Learning ideas. These ideas mostly use separate/isolated Quantum and Classical circuits and then combine them in a sequential or parallel configuration. As an example, if we talk about variational quantum circuits for machine learning, I have mostly seen the use of transfer learning, either majorly quantum variational circuits optimized by classical algorithms or majorly classical circuit(s) taking input as the output of some other quantum system .eg. in the case of Quantum Convolutional Networks or Kernels. Recently, there has also been some progress in the field of implementing the concept of spiking-neurons in the Quantum paradigm. Taking inspiration from these recent developments, a slightly unique idea that I had thought of was the implementation of a **real** Quantum-Hybrid network in Neural Networks.

Talking about the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the idea can be seen as a mixture of perceptrons and a few qubits in each of the layers. Between two consecutive layers, the idea proposes entanglement of qubits from one layer to those of the other layer. Graphically, the implementations looks like:
